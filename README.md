# dot-files

Collection of `.files` used in my local environment with my setup.

## Setup context

The dot files within the repo are pertaining to `bash` use within my `linux` environment (my OS) as well as my
chosen `window manager` with others like `tmux`. Nowadays I don't use as much `tmux` locally as I've found better
use cases fitting to my style of workflow. Nonetheless, here are my `dot-files`.
